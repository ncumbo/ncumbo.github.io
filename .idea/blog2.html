            <h1>How the Legalization of Sports Betting can fix the US debt problem</h1>

            <hr>
            <p>On November 26, 2018,  the victory at the Supreme Court of New Jersey has declared
            that any state can legalize sports betting if they wish to.  Currently, there are
            8 states with full-scale legalized sports betting, 2 states with a recent bill passed,
            and 20 states moving towards legalization.  That is more than half of the United States
            in support of the legalisation of sports betting.</p>

            <p>According to the federal government, the United States national debt as of January 2019
            is approximately $24.56 trillion.  Most of the public debt in the United States is from
            the federal government who provide goods and services for the benefit of the American people.</p>

            <p>The United States is trying to do many things to get out of debt, but I believe the
            easiest way is right in front of them.</p>

            <p>Australia, Ghana, Mexico, Nigeria,and the United Kingdom all allow gambling on sports.
            That being said there are markets and bookies all over the world that would love to
            risk putting themselves or the United States in even more debt.</p>

            <p>I'm not saying the US should bet $15 Trillion on a UB -9.5 and St. Johns +6.5 parlay
            with the multiplier of 2-1 on an overseas bookie.  All i'm saying is that since sports
            betting is legal in the majority of the United States, the federal government should
            diversify some of its investments on oversea sports betting.</p>
